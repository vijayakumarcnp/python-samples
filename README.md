# python-samples/README

The objective of this repo is to provide examples of professional use of the Python language.

There are plenty of other sites and repos offering code to play games or demonstrate a coding trick.

Not here. 

Here we aim to provide code that exhibit the security and technical features needed in a (hostile) production environment where debugging needs to occur quickly.

## Projects

* <strong>myutils.py</strong> is a private python module that provides myutil_ functions used in other Python programs in this repo:

* <strong>gcp-services.py</strong> is a conglomeration of many features.
* <strong>mondrian-gen.py</strong> to generate a png art in the style of Mondrian. References macOS Keychain to keep OpenAI API key.
* <strong>openweather.py</strong> to obtain from API calls and format weather data (as fuzzy tokens)
* <strong>saytime.py</strong> to use the macos say CLI command to voice the time or other text.
* <strong>sorting.py</strong> to run different sorting algorithms to compare performance as n rises, on a matplotlib visualization.
* <strong>youtube-download.py</strong> downloads videos based on its URL from a list of URLs in a CSV file.

## Coding Practices to use MyUtils

Below are notes about coding practices, from the top down:

1.  At the very top of the file:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```
    That enables you to run the program as a script without typing python3:
    ```bash
    ./mondrian-gen.py
    ```
    instead of 
    ```bash
    python3 mondrian-gen.py
    ```

1.  This specifies that emjois and non-English characters (such as Japanese, Chinese, etc.) may be in the code file:
    ```python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    ```

1.  SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) license identifiers provide machine-readable tags to communicate the license governing a piece of software. 
    ```python
    # SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0
    ```
    The MPL-2.0 (Mozilla Public License version 2.0) is a moderately permissive open-source license with some copyleft provisions. Its key characteristics include:
    * Allows code to be freely used, modified, and shared
    * Requires modifications to MPL-licensed files to be shared under the same license
    * Allows MPL-licensed code to be combined with code under different licenses
    * Provides patent protection for contributors and users
    * Requires preservation of copyright notices

1.  Dunder (double underscore) variables in the module define metadata about the program. PEP specifies that such variables can be read by other programs without opening the source code.
    ```python
    __commit_date__ = "2025-05-20"
    __version__ = "1.0.0"
    __author__ = "Your Name"
    __license__ = "MIT"
    __commit_date__ = "2025-05-20"
    __status__ = "Production"
    __doc__ = "This module demonstrates the use of dunder (double underscore) variables in Python."
    ```
    # TODO: Some also have like <tt>__commit_hash__ = "a1b2c3d4e5f6"</tt>
    # But How to get the commit hash? Doesn't adding it change the hash value?

1.  To capture the program start time at the earliest moment, the built-in time module is used:
    ```python
    import time
    std_strt_timestamp = time.monotonic()
    ```
    <tt>time.monotonic()</tt> returns the time since an arbitrary point in the past, which is not affected by system clock changes.

1.  External dependencies are specified in a requirements.txt file.
    ```python
    import requests
    ```

1.  Within the requirements.txt file, the <strong>myutils</strong> module is loaded to provide all other custom Python programs in this repo:
   ```python
   import myutils
   ```

1.  Modules used The ast (Abstract Syntax Tree) module parses Python source code into a structure so code can be better analyzed or modified programmatically.
   ```python
   import ast
   ```
   ast is used by linters, type checkers, and other such tools to analyze code without running it.

1.  All functions defined in this file are prefixed with myutil_ to avoid name conflicts in other modules.
    ```python
    def myutil_print(msg):
        print(msg)
    ```

1.  The function issuing a message to the console is printed along with the message:
    ```python
    def myutil_print(msg):
        print(msg)
    ```
