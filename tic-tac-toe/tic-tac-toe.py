   Not yet explained at https://wilsonmar.github.io/python-samples 
   This is a classic two-player game played to settle an arugment to simply achieve world peace.
   Thus, this program does not provide the intelligence to play a human.
   
   This program can be manually run by "chmod +x tic-tac-toe-oop.py" then "./tic-tac-toe-oop.py".
   See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6CCdCBVypg
   
   Alternately, this file is within a folder so that, during unit testing, this program can be 
   run automatically after a one-time CLI "pip install pytest" to load the popular third-party 
   testing framework with a more concise syntax and powerful features compared to unittest.
   
   Unit-testing command "pytest" auto-discovers and executes all test files named with prefix "test_".
   They determine whether outputs are correct given a sset of inputs.

   NOTE: In the code, 3 characters are used to indent.
   
   This program starts by executing the "create_board" function to define a 3x3 grid of underlines.
   The "show_board" function displays the grid.
   Alternately, dividing lines can be added like at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Djh-Cbgi0E
   
   This program presents a text-based UI (not a Tkinter GUI) as in 
   https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-python/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNCpUS4d1Oo
   https://github.com/softwareNuggets/Python_TKInter_Tic_Tac_Toe/blob/main/tic_tac_toe_pro.py
   which can be turned into a mobile app.

   Logic in this code uses object-oriented programming concepts important to learn and use.
   The class "TicTacToe" encapsulates attributes, methods, and behaviors of game play.
   
   The "random" module is imported to enable "random.randint(0, 1)" within 
   function "get_random_first_player".

   Within an infinite loop, the game_over flag is set after evaluating the result of each move.
   A win goes to the first player to mark three Os or Xs diagonally, horizontally, or vertically,
   as determined by function "has_player_won".
   
   Each player must also block their opponent while attempting to make their chain.
   Thus, this code has a nested loops to check for winning columns, rows, and diagonals.

   Two players in the game alternate turns to mark the board with O or X.
   
   To the prompt "Enter row & column numbers to fix spot: _"
   each player enters two numbers separated by a space, such a "1 3" for row 1 column 3.

   Alternately, a number 1-9 can be used as in https://replit.com/login?source=new-repl&goto=%2Fnew%2Fpython3

   Game play can be interrupted any time by manually pressing Control+C on macOS for a KeyboardInterrupt.

   QUESTION: What does function "fix_spot" do?
   
   TODO: Check whether a spot is already taken and request another choice.

   TODO: Recognize if a winning hand is present and alert players, as in
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13734121/python-oop-tic-tac-toe

   game_over is identified when the "is_board_filled()" condition is met.

   The program stops when there is a tie or a winner.

   TODO: At end of game, create another game and keep score.
